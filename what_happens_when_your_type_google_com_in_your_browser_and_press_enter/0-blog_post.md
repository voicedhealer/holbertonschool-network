This classic interview question tests fundamental web stack knowledge. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each step in the process:

## 1. DNS Request
When you type "https://www.google.com" and hit Enter, the first step is DNS (Domain Name System) resolution:

- **Browser Cache Check**: Your browser first checks its DNS cache for a recent record of google.com
- **Operating System Cache**: If not found, the OS checks its DNS cache
- **ISP DNS Resolver**: Your computer queries your ISP's DNS resolver
- **Root Nameservers**: If uncached, the resolver contacts root nameservers for .com TLD information
- **TLD Nameservers**: The resolver then queries .com TLD servers
- **Authoritative Nameservers**: Finally, Google's authoritative nameservers provide the actual IP address (e.g., 142.250.190.46)
- **Caching**: The IP is cached at multiple levels for future requests

## 2. TCP/IP Connection
Once the IP address is resolved, your browser establishes a TCP connection:

- **Three-Way Handshake**:
  1. **SYN**: Client sends synchronization packet
  2. **SYN-ACK**: Server acknowledges and sends its own sync packet
  3. **ACK**: Client acknowledges, connection established
- **Port 443**: Connection established on port 443 for HTTPS (port 80 for HTTP)

## 3. Firewall
Network traffic passes through various firewalls:
- **Local Firewall**: Your computer's firewall checks outgoing requests
- **Corporate/ISP Firewalls**: May filter traffic based on security policies
- **Google's Firewalls**: Filter incoming requests based on security rules and traffic patterns

## 4. HTTPS/SSL
Since this is an HTTPS request, encryption is established:
- **SSL/TLS Handshake**: Browser and server negotiate encryption protocols
- **Certificate Verification**: Browser verifies Google's SSL certificate
- **Symmetric Key Exchange**: Secure keys are exchanged for data encryption
- **Encrypted Channel**: All subsequent communication is encrypted

## 5. Load Balancer
Google receives millions of requests, so load balancers distribute traffic:
- **Request Distribution**: Load balancer routes your request to an available server
- **Algorithm**: Uses algorithms like Round Robin or Least Connections
- **Health Checks**: Ensures requests only go to healthy servers
- **Geographic Routing**: May route to servers closest to your location

## 6. Web Server
The request reaches Google's web server (likely Nginx or custom software):
- **HTTP Request Processing**: Parses your GET request for the homepage
- **Static Content**: Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
- **Reverse Proxy**: May forward dynamic requests to application servers

## 7. Application Server
For dynamic content, the web server communicates with application servers:
- **Business Logic**: Processes search algorithms, user personalization
- **Session Management**: Handles user authentication if logged in
- **API Calls**: Makes internal API calls for various Google services

## 8. Database
Application servers query databases for dynamic content:
- **User Data**: Retrieves personalization settings if logged in
- **Search Index**: Accesses Google's massive search index
- **Caching**: Uses Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data
- **Distributed Systems**: Queries across multiple database clusters

## Response Journey Back
The process reverses to deliver the webpage:
1. **Database** returns query results to application server
2. **Application Server** processes data and generates response
3. **Web Server** packages the complete HTTP response
4. **Load Balancer** routes response back through established connection
5. **HTTPS/SSL** encrypts the response data
6. **Firewall** allows the encrypted response through
7. **TCP/IP** delivers packets reliably to your browser
8. **DNS** (cached entry used for any additional resources)
9. **Browser** renders the HTML, CSS, and executes JavaScript

## Browser Rendering
Finally, your browser displays the page:
- **HTML Parsing**: Constructs the DOM tree
- **CSS Processing**: Applies styling rules
- **JavaScript Execution**: Runs interactive elements
- **Additional Requests**: Fetches images, fonts, and other resources
- **Page Display**: Renders the complete Google homepage

This entire process typically completes in under 100 milliseconds, demonstrating the incredible efficiency of modern web infrastructure.
